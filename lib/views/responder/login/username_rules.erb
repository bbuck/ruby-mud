Learon is a fantasy themed Roleplaying game, therefore there are a few rules
that your Character name must conform to.
[f:green]
  1. We do not accept Modern names such as Brandon, John, Jennifer, or Amber.

  2. Names that are part of other stories such as those out of books, games, or
     movies are not allowed.

  3. Names of Mythological characters or Gods are not allowed.[reset]

Try to choose a name that is unique for your character and unique to the world.
